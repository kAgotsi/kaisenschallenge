Python test

# Documentation
Each function is documented
 
# Execution and test
In order to test my work, You have to install python,
and run the Test.py file.

I've defined default test sets that you can change by replacing
the parameters of each function in the main function with your data.


Thank you for the opportunity you gave me.
